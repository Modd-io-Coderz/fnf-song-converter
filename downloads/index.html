		<h2>Friday Night Funkin' Scratch Project Downloads</h2>
		Take your pick on what project you want to download. <b>Unless you absolutely need Winter Horrorland, I recommend the latest version.</b>
		<br>
		<br>
		<b><u>Remember: if you're not making any significant changes to the gameplay, please credit my work in the Notes and Credits section.</u></b> I spent a lot of time on it, and if you don't put it near the top, people won't see it. <b>Also, if you are directly reuploading my project, please don't modify my watermarks to add your own name.</b> I mean, if you're not making any changes, it seems kinda silly, right?

		<h3><span class="material-icons">inbox</span> Changelog</h3>
		<li>v17 (4/22/2021) - Fixed some background things, and made note timing much more precise (apparently i wasn't checking note presses fast enough).</li>
		<li>v16 (4/21/2021) - OKAY, I know I said I wouldn't do Week 7. Well, here we are. Updated menus and UI, improved performance, and Week 7, along with another re-release. I should stop promising I won't do things...</li>
		<li>v15 (4/17/2021) - Added downscroll as a native feature! Toggle with Q in the menu.</li>
		<li>v14 (3/29/2021) - Added a misses counter and local high scores- try to get perfect!</li>
		<li>v13 (3/8/2021) - Fixed the bug on pixel songs where held notes didn't display properly. Also, figured I'd package this into a release.</li>
		<li>v12v2 (3/7/2021) - Fixed ANOTHER giant bug with note detection (should actually work now?)</li>
		<li>v12v1 (3/7/2021) - Fixed giant bug with note detection, whoops</li>
		<li>v12 (3/7/2021) - fixed MASSIVE bug where more than one note could be hit at once, causing problems- combos are like... actually possible now (although there may be more lag)- also polished a few things</li>
		<li>v11 (3/6/2021) - made the internals a bit more friendly to modding.</li>
		<li>v10 (2/25/2021) - fixed held notes [finally]. It might lag a little more, but at least it's fixed</li>
		<li>v9v2 (2/25/2021) - ALRIGHT FINE, I made the timing more lenient lol</li>
		<li>v9v1 (2/23/2021) - fixed bug where you could get points by spamming the keys on held notes (thanks @friday_night_funkinF)</li>
		<li>v9 (2/23/2021) - scoring systems! compete with the world to get the highest scores on all difficulties.</li>
		<li>v8 (or i guess 2.0, 2/22/2021) - reuploaded back to Scratch! hopefully i'm actually not taken down this time. includes some improvements to gameplay, and also finishes off all the songs!</li>
		<br>
		<li>v7 (2/11/2021) - overhaul of how notes are counted as "hit" or "missed"! it now relies on the timer directly, so it should be more accurate (in most cases >:( )</li>
		<li>v6 (2/11/2021) - added [most] of Week 6. I just have the spirit's sprites left, but I'll do that sometime soon. also fixed some bugs, but there's prob more</li>
		<li>v5v1 - fixed bug where you could die in the menu (whoops, thanks @undertale_guy6394647); if you REALLY wanna experience it enable debug mode</li>
		<li>v5 (2/10/2021) - Added Week 5 and a quirky warning for Winter Horrorland (v8 update: has been removed)</li>
		<li>v4 (2/9/2021) - No internal changes, but it's now possible to convert songs from FNF! (See the READ ME sprite inside.)</li>
		<li>v3 (2/9/2021) - you can now choose between different song difficulties. also i may have bloated this project 3x, whoops</li>
		<li>v2 (2/9/2021) - added week 2 and 4. isn't that funky. also a lot of animations should be more in time now</li>
		<li>v1 (2/8/2021) - i did it, i made the game. have fun playing weeks 1 and 3 because i am too lazy to do 2</li>
