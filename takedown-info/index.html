			<h3>So... it's gone. Again.</h3>
			My "Friday Night Funkin'" Scratch project has recently been banned from being mass reported, for the second time. ...I'm sorry? I don't understand why on earth people would report it. I'm literally done.
			<br>I don't think I can handle another cycle of "share, wait a few days, get my account banned, wait a few days more" again. I'm just so done with having my work that I spent hours on be taken down because apparently some people can't handle... whatever it is. Not cool!</br>
			<br><b>What was wrong with it? I have no clue.</b></br>
			<br>Why does my project get shut down over and over, but others stay up? I don't know either. Is it guns? Is the presence of a gun the reason why my project was [most likely permanently] taken down and my account temp banned? I have no way of knowing.</br>
			<br>I'm hoping Scratch Team will put my project back up when they get around to it, in, I don't know, a week... but considering their track record, I don't have high hopes. Geez, I need a break...</br>
			<br></br>
			Sorry for the rant. In the mean time...<br></br><div style="line-height: 3em"><b><a href="https://ninja-muffin24.itch.io/funkin" style="text-decoration: none; color:white; padding:0.5em; background-color:#ff4d5c; margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom:1em; border-radius:0.25em"><span class="material-icons">videogame_asset</span> Play the original game on itch.io</a> <a href="https://turbowarp.org/491440657/" style="text-decoration: none; color:white; padding:0.5em; background-color:#0fbd8c; margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom:1em; border-radius:0.25em"><span class="material-icons">sports_esports</span> Play my game via Turbowarp</a> <a href="https://mega.nz/file/XkZmhbbJ#2kbY-ZO5yrSjV1Ke8RHlTKqiC4_rBuVgmUJdslu_tpE" style="text-decoration: none; color:white; padding:0.5em; background-color:#4d97ff; margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom:1em; border-radius:0.25em"><span class="material-icons">get_app</span> Download the .sb3 file for use offline</a></b></div>

			<i>Note: If you're going to reupload or archive my project without making any significant changes, it'd be nice if you credited me in some way in your Notes and Credits section. Thanks!</i>
			<h2><span class="material-icons">help</span> Some quick QnA:</h2>
			<h3><span class="material-icons">question_answer</span> Why was it taken down? Did Scratch Team see it?</h3>
			<b>It was entirely the fault of mass reporting, and Scratch Team has not seen it yet.</b> If you didn't know, when too many people report a project for something, it gets taken down automatically and you need to wait a week or two for Scratch Team to either approve or deny it. It's a huge pain, and prevents your game from being seen by <i>anyone</i>, except through external programs such as Turbowarp.
			<h3><span class="material-icons">question_answer</span> Can't you just reupload it? What's the big deal?</h3>
			<b>It will be taken down again if I do that (it'll only be a matter of time).</b> Also, it might count as ban evasion, which... doesn't help my case in the slightest. For now, it'll be down on my account. I don't want to get anyone's hopes up unfairly.
			<h3><span class="material-icons">question_answer</span> Can I reupload it? I see you linked a .sb3 file.</h3>
			<b>Yes, though if you're not making any significant changes to the gameplay, I'd like it if you credited me.</b> I don't have a problem with people reuploading my stuff, but if you're just directly copying it to act as an archive, please credit my work. I spent a lot of time on it, and if you don't put it near the top of the Notes and Credits section, people won't see it. Also, I've seen people have their own projects taken down for not crediting me there, so... take with that what you will.
			<br><b><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/492327181/">This project is a good example of how credit should be given.</a></b></br>
			<h3><span class="material-icons">question_answer</span> When do you think it will be back up on your account?</h3>
			<b>If everything goes according to plan... I don't know, a week?</b> If Scratch Team reapproves it, then... woo! It'll be back here. Last time it took them a week to... not approve it, so... here's hoping my luck is different this time.
			<h3><span class="material-icons">question_answer</span> What'll you do next if Scratch Team denies the project?</h3>
			<b>I probably won't upload it a third time, or at least, not in that form.</b> I know people rightfully like the project, and I'm glad that they do, but I really can't risk being temp-banned again for this dumb project. I know that's the sad truth, and people will want it back up so they can give thanks to the original developer, but... I just can't. I'm sorry.
			<br>I may release an extra version I've been working on called OpenFNF, which lets you easily create your own songs and remix them to show to the world, but that'll be later.</br>
			<h3><span class="material-icons">question_answer</span> Why was it taken down???</h3>
			<b>Your guess is as good as mine.</b> I don't know what goes on inside the heads of people who reported my project, but judging by some of the comments people think the "Funkin'" in "Friday Night Funkin'" is talking about... you know what? I don't really understand, but... that's the sad truth. (And I'm not just going to rename it to something else, that'd be weird)
			<h3><span class="material-icons">question_answer</span> I want to support you and your project. How can I do that?</h3>
			<b>Really, all I ask is that you properly credit my work when it is needed (and follow me if you want).</b> If people are passing it off as their own, or just forgetting to credit me, give them a friendly heads-up. I love to see what people do with my stuff, so remix it and add your own flair! I'm working on making beatmap creation easier too, so stay tuned for that.
			<br></br>
			<br><b>Thank you for playing my game. Hopefully this will all be resolved soon.</b></br>
