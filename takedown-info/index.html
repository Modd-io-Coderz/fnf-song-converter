			<i>Last updated 2/11 6:26 PM PST</i>
			<h3>So... it's gone.</h3>
			My "Friday Night Funkin'" Scratch project has recently been banned from being mass reported. I'm sorry to everyone that wanted to play, but couldn't, and hopefully I can reach some sort of resolution with the Scratch Team so that it can remain standing, but this is the current state of things.
			<br>For now, the project will remain down. There are ways to get around this (most Scratch emulators can access hidden projects, some people may have saved or remixed the project), but I will not link any here. The Scratch Team says it "may take a few weeks" to get back to me, which I am not happy with, but I guess I can do nothing but wait at this time.</br>
			<br>I've contemplated making a lighter, more easily accessible version without many of the more problematic songs and scenes that could be modded much easier, but at the moment I just want to wait for a response from the Scratch Team before making any drastic decisions.</br>
			<br></br>
			Hopefully this will be resolved soon. In the mean time, <a href="https://ninja-muffin24.itch.io/funkin">maybe give the original game some love</a>?
			<br></br>
			<br></br>
			<i>And don't worry, I'll still continue to make new things on Scratch occasionally. They probably won't be as ambitious as this one was, though.</i>
